<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Hernia Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical hernia mesh market can be segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable meshes are designed to degrade over time, providing temporary support during the healing process before being absorbed by the body. This type reduces long-term complications but may not provide sustained strength. Non-absorbable meshes, on the other hand, consist of materials that remain in the body permanently, offering long-lasting support and durability. Both types aim to effectively treat hernias, with specific applications based on patient needs.</p></p>
